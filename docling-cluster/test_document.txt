Sovereign OS Test Document

This is a test document for the Asynchronous RAG Pipeline.

The system implements a deterministic emulator-checkpointing architecture that ensures:
1. Provenance tracking through SHA-256 content hashing
2. L2 normalization for semantic similarity searches
3. Batch processing with GPU acceleration
4. Cryptographic attestation via the Sovereign Wallet Proxy

Every chunk receives a unique identity anchored to its content hash, maintaining the Constitutional Braid's integrity across the entire semantic memory system.

The Scribe worker processes documents asynchronously, ensuring high-velocity ingestion while preserving mathematical honesty through fail-closed verification protocols.
